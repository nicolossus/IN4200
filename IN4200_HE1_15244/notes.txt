in order to conform with the tasks in the assignment, in particular unit testing and benchmarking,
it was deemed necessary to make top_n wrap a function for calculating the top n webpages
from a practical point of view.
Why?
-to verbose in benchmark with the repeating output from print
-be able to unit test the code
This is not ideal as this adds another for-loop to the algorithm. However, the loop is only
over n, thus not adding much complexity in normal use cases, and it might be seen
as an advantage to be able to store the top ranked nodes in an array. So all in all,
this approached may be justified. The calc_top f




make sure that there is enough work so you don't encounter overhead
