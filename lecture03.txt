Single precision (SP) - 32 bit
Double precision (DP) - 64 bit


Modern computer architecture techniques to improve throughput

* pipeline - goal: to produce one result per cycle

* superscalarity - goal: to produce more than one result per cycle. Need multiple
  pipelines running in parallel

* SIMD - important: wide registers - store many FP and is able to operate on them
  simultaneously


Memory hierarchy

* CPU has access to registers without delay

* Several levels (L) of cache holding copies of recently used data

* Main memory, much slower to access


Cache

Caches are low-capacity, high-speed memories that are commonly integrated on
the CPU die.

* L1 (level 1) data cache
* L1 instruction cache
* L2 & L3 (data & instruction) unified caches

Purpose: reduce impact of main memory's small bandwidth and high latency.

Cache hit and miss. Hit if data is in L1 cache, miss if not. In case of miss, data
must be fetched from upper cache level or worst-case main memory.

If full cache: one of the occupant entries has to be evicted so new data item can be
loaded. Typically following least-recently used strategy to give space

Temporal locality: good if data items loaded into a cache are to be used again "soon enough"

tau - speed ratio between cache and main memory, cache is a factor of tau faster than accessing main mëm.
beta - probability of cache hit


Cache lines
A line has space for multiple data item, contigous in memory.
Spatial locality: good if the probability of successive accesses to neighboring items is high


Cache mapping
* Fully associative mapping: line of data item from main mem. can be freely placed on any
  unoccupied cache line

* Directly mapped: a line of data items can be placed only on a prescribed cache line
  - runs the risk of low cache utilization.

* Partially associative mapping: combination
